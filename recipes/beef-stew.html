        <p>Beef stew is delicious and easy to make. A blend of beef, potatoes,
        vegetables and herbs</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 pound beef stewing meat, trimmed and cut into inch cubes</li>
            <li>5 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup red wine</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups beef broth, homemade or low-sodium canned</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>5 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4 inch rounds</li>
            <li>2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4 inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour and pepper in a bowl, add the beef and toss to
                coat well. Heat 3 teaspoons of the oil in a large pot. Add the
                beef a few pieces at a time; do not overcrowd. Cook, turning the
                pieces until beef is browned on all sides, about 5 minutes per
                batch; add more oil as needed between batches.</li>
            <li>Remove the beef from the pot and add the vinegar and wine. Cook
                over medium-high heat, scraping the pan with a wooden spoon to
                loosen any browned bits. Add the beef, beef broth and bay leaves.
                Bring to a boil, then reduce to a slow simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook, skimming broth from time to time, until the beef
                is tender, about 1Â½ hours. Add the onions and carrots and simmer,
                covered, for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes and simmer until
                vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more. Add broth or water
                if the stew is dry. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Ladle
                among 4 bowls and serve.</li>
        </ol>
